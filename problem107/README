Using network.txt (right click and 'Save Link/Target As...'), a 6K text file
containing a network with forty vertices, and given in matrix form, find the
maximum saving which can be achieved by removing redundant edges whilst
ensuring that the network remains connected.

USAGE
    ./solution.py [--dot] [input]
or
    python solution.py [--dot] [input]

If --dot is used, a DOT language file is produced that describes the tree
generated in solving the problem. If input is not specified, the script looks
for network.txt in the current directory.
